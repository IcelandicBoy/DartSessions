// Think of at least three different animals that have a common characteristic.
// Store the names of these animals in a list, and then use a
// for loop to print out the name of each animal.

//    *   Modify your program to print a statement about each animal,
//        such e.g Hamsters are cute pets.

//    *   Add a line at the end of your program stating what these
//        animals have in common. You should print a sentence such as
//        "Any of these animals would make cute pets".
